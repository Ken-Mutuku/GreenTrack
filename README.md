## Blockchain-Based Supply Chain System for Fresh Produce Traceability

### Project Overview
The Blockchain-Based Supply Chain System is a solution designed to address the lack of transparency and traceability in agricultural supply chains. This system records product information on a **blockchain network** and provides QR code-based traceability for consumers to verify the origin, quality, and authenticity of fresh produce.

### Key Features
- Blockchain-based data storage for immutable product records
- QR Code Generation for each produce batch
- Consumer-friendly QR Code Scanning Interface
- Verified product quality information
- Basic AI Summary Module for generating product descriptions
- Secure, transparent, and accessible records

### Technology Stack
- Blockchain Platform: Hyperledger Fabric
- Frontend Framework: React Native
- Backend API: Node.js + Express.js
- Database: MongoDB
- QR Code Generation: QR Code API
- AI Module: TensorFlow (Minimal use)
- Cloud Hosting: AWS EC2

### System Workflow
1. Farmer Brings Produce to Collection Point
2. Agency Tests Produce Quality
3. Quality Test Results Input into System
4. Blockchain Network Stores Data
5. QR Code Generated and Linked to Blockchain Record
6. Consumer Scans QR Code to Verify Product Origin and Quality**



 ### QR Code Demonstration
- Generate QR codes for each produce batch using the QR Code Generator API.
- Scan QR codes via the mobile application to access product traceability information.
